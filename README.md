# Little Lemon Restaurant API
Cousera (Meta) Back-End Developer Specialization project for module 7 - The Full Stack.

In preparation for a role in back-end development, i practiced bringing together multiple skills to build a full-stack Django app. I started by setting up an environment for a local practical project, and refactoring the front and back-ends of an existing application, then i had the opportunity to create the front and back-ends of a new application using my full-stack developer skills.

### You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course and use them to:
* Connect the Little Lemon restaurant back-end to MySQL
* Set up a Little Lemon restaurant booking API
* Display the Little Lemon restaurantâ€™s available booking times

### By the end of the course i was able to:
* Explain common concepts related to full stack development
* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop well-structured, interactive and responsive websites
* Build a full stack application using Django that stores its data in models on a MySQL database and updates its pages with forms and API endpoints
* Describe the different environments that web applications are deployed to.
